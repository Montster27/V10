   - IBM Plex Mono for code and technical elements

3. **Color Palette**:
   - Teal (#00A5A5) - Primary color
   - Navy (#004E66) - Secondary color
   - Salmon (#FF6B6B) - Accent color
   - Pink (#FF70A6) - Accent color
   - Mint (#7BE495) - Accent color
   - Cream (#FFF9E0) - Background accent

4. **Key UI Elements**:
   - Sharp-cornered panels with decorative borders
   - Distinctive buttons with hover effects
   - Cards with signature corner details
   - Patterned progress bars

## Implementation

The Miami Retro theme has been implemented as follows:

1. Main theme file: `src/config/themes/variations/miami-retro-theme.js`
2. Applied in `src/index.js` using ChakraProvider
3. Required fonts added to `public/index.html` and `src/components/ui/Fonts.js`

## Theme Test Results

The Miami Retro theme was selected because it:

1. Best captures the nostalgic 80s feel while maintaining readability
2. Provides strong visual distinction between different UI elements
3. Offers excellent contrast for resource indicators
4. Creates a playful yet sophisticated atmosphere that appeals to the target audience
5. Balances between authentic period styling and modern usability requirements

## Future Theme Considerations

While the theme testing has been completed and Miami Retro implemented, the project structure still supports theme switching. If desired, an in-game theme selector could be added in the future to allow players to customize their experience.
