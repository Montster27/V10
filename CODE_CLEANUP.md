# Code Cleanup Changes

This document outlines the changes made in the `code-cleanup` branch to improve code quality and maintainability before adding more complex features.

## 1. Code Organization

### 1.1 Directory Structure
- Created separate directories for better organization:
  - `/config`: Game constants and configuration
  - `/data`: Game data (events, skills)
  - `/utils`: Utility functions
  - `/components/ui`: Reusable UI components
  - `/components/skills`: Skills-related components

### 1.2 Code Separation
- Separated data from logic:
  - Moved event definitions to `/data/events.js`
  - Moved skill definitions to `/data/skills.js`
  - Moved constants to `/config/gameConstants.js`

## 2. Improved Game Loop

- Refactored game loop initialization
- Added proper cleanup
- Implemented auto-save functionality
- Added error handling

## 3. Utility Functions

- Created utility modules:
  - `resourceUtils.js`: Functions for resource calculations
  - `storageUtils.js`: Functions for save/load operations
  - `timeUtils.js`: Date formatting and manipulation

## 4. Reusable UI Components

- Created reusable UI components:
  - `Panel.js`: Consistent panel containers
  - `Button.js`: Standardized buttons
  - `ResourceBar.js`: Resource display bars
  - `Slider.js`: Enhanced sliders with impact display

## 5. Redux Store Improvements

- Enhanced Redux slices:
  - Better organization of reducers
  - More consistent state updates
  - Added selectors for common data access patterns
  - Improved action creators

## 6. Type Safety

- Added PropTypes to components for better type checking
- Improved function parameter documentation
- Added proper JSDoc comments

## 7. Component Structure

- Improved component organization:
  - SkillCard and SkillCategory components for better reuse
  - Consistent UI patterns across different panels
  - Removed duplicate code

## 8. Resource Calculation

- Centralized impact calculations
- Eliminated duplication of formulas
- Added helper functions for common operations

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Code is better organized and easier to understand
2. **Extensibility**: Adding new features will be simpler
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and state management
4. **Performance**: More efficient updates
5. **Reusability**: More components can be reused

## Next Steps

With this improved foundation, we can now safely add more complex features:
- Enhanced event system
- Save/load improvements
- More sophisticated skills and effects
- Visual feedback and animations
- Tutorial system
