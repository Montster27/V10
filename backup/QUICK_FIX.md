# Quick Fix for Chakra UI Integration

If you're experiencing compilation errors or slider visibility issues after updating to Chakra UI, here are quick steps to get the app running again:

## Option 1: Fix Sliders and Install Chakra UI (Recommended)

Run the fix-sliders script to install all dependencies and fix visibility issues:

```bash
chmod +x fix-sliders.sh
./fix-sliders.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install all required Chakra UI dependencies
2. Clean npm cache to prevent stale modules
3. Start the application

## Option 2: Standard Chakra UI Installation

If the slider script doesn't help, you can try a normal installation:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

After installation, restart your development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Option 3: Use Fallback Version (Temporary Solution)

If you need to get the app running immediately without installing new dependencies, you can temporarily use the fallback version:

1. Run the fallback script:

```bash
chmod +x use-fallback.sh
./use-fallback.sh
```

2. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

**Note:** Using the fallback version will revert to the original UI without Chakra UI enhancements. We recommend installing the Chakra UI dependencies for the best experience.
