# Miami Retro Branch Setup

We have created a new branch called "miami-retro" to continue development with the Miami Retro theme.

## Creating the Branch

To create and switch to the new branch, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/montysharma/Documents/V10/simplified
chmod +x create-branch.sh
./create-branch.sh
```

## Branch Information

- **Branch Name**: miami-retro
- **Base Branch**: The branch was created from the current state of the codebase
- **Purpose**: Continue development with the Miami Retro theme implementation

## Next Steps

1. Continue development on the miami-retro branch
2. When ready to merge changes back to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge miami-retro
   ```

3. To push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin miami-retro
   ```

## Development Focus

Now that we have the Miami Retro theme implemented, we can focus on:
- Content development (more events, narrative progression)
- Game balance improvements
- Enhanced user experience (animations, sound effects)
- Additional features (auto-save, achievements, statistics)
